# Extism Python Host SDK

This repo contains the Python package for integrating with the
[Extism](https://extism.org/) Webassembly framework. Install this library into
your Python application host to run Extism WebAssembly guest plug-ins.

```python
import extism
import json

manifest = {"wasm": [{"url": "https://github.com/extism/plugins/releases/latest/download/count_vowels.wasm"}]}
with extism.Plugin(manifest, wasi=True) as plugin:
    wasm_vowel_count = plugin.call(
        "count_vowels",
        "hello world",
        parse = lambda output: json.loads(bytes(output).decode('utf-8'))
    )
print(wasm_vowel_count) # {'count': 3, 'total': 3, 'vowels': 'aeiouAEIOU'}
```

## Installation

Install this package from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/extism/):

```shell
# using pip
$ pip install extism==1.0.0

2. Push that tag to the repository (`git push origin v1.0.0`.)
3. Wait for [the Build workflow to run](https://github.com/extism/python-sdk/actions/workflows/build.yaml).
4. Once the build workflow finishes, go to the [releases](https://github.com/extism/python-sdk/releases) page. You should
   see a draft release.
5. Edit the draft release. Publish the release.
6. Wait for [the Release workflow to run](https://github.com/extism/python-sdk/actions/workflows/release.yaml).
